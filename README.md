# NorthernBobwhiteCNN
Code and data for training and evaluating a convolutional neural network for Northern Bobwhite covey call detection.

# Data added
We have uploaded a sample of our dataset of Northern Bobwhite covey call recordings in wav file format used to train the CNN: 90 4 second presence clips and 90 4 second absences clips (30 from each of the three groups of sites: WLFW-GA, WLFW-AL and DiLane). Due to the large size and confidential nature of the sites, all acoustic data is not uploaded here, but can be made available on request. See: TrainingClips-Presence and TrainingClips-Absence folders for clips.
